# datascience
The main purpose of this document is to describe, scope and plan my own education into Data Science.
Therefore this repository will more or less reflect my travel working and improving in the field af Data Science knowledge, skills and competences.
I will improve by e-learning courses, attending on-line lectures and seminars, Youtube videos like StatQuest and 3Blue1Brown, reading supplemental books finding samples in Kaggle and of course finding other samples in GitHub.
My developmentplatform will be based upon WinPy 3.6 command consoles and PyCharm
I started March 2021 and plan 4 Tracks, see below, for the next 12 months.
This repository will also have a content of directories according to the book - Data Science from Scratch, amongst others of course
Tracks as follows:
Track0 Explores ML and Python
Track1 Machine Learning Programmer
Track2 Deep Learning programmer
Track3 Machine Learning Engineer
Track4 Machine Learning Architect
As times goes by I will improve in a an agile way according to the 12 agile principles
